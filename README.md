# Memory-Matching-Game
A Memory Matching Game involves players flipping two face-down cards at a time from a grid, aiming to find identical pairs, keeping matched pairs and taking another turn, while non-matches are flipped back, with the goal of collecting the most pairs by remembering card locations to improve recall and build cognitive skills like visual memory, focus, and concentration.
